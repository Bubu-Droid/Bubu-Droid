### Hi there :wave:

I’m Avigyan (AKA Bubu-Droid), a math and CS enthusiast.
I enjoy ricing my setup, writing scripts,
and working in web-development a lot.
If you’re interested, you may check out
[my website][bubuwebsite].

- :telescope: I’m currently working on web-development
  and Linux ricing
- :seedling: I’m currently learning more about shell scripting
  and DevSecOps
